    <string name="charles_church_details">"Charles Church is the second most ancient parish church in Plymouth, Devon in England. The senior church is St Andrew's Church, the mother church of Plymouth.\n\nThe church was an important centre of spiritual life for the city for 300 years; boasted a number of important clergy; and was the mother of many existing churches. During the nights of 21 and 22 March 1941, the church was entirely burned out by incendiary bombs. Although now a monument, the tradition of ministry at \"Charles\" is not lost and is carried on by the Parish of Charles with St Matthias, one of its daughter churches a quarter of a mile away to the north. It is an important landmark for the city of Plymouth.\n\nThere have been several histories made of the church including two written in the early 20th century. Most focus on the fabric of the building rather than the spiritual life of the church and ministers, of whom Robert Hawker was a notable figure. There are several short accounts of his life and some much longer works. \n\nCredit to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Church,_Plymouth"</string>

Situated behind the ruined Charles Church, preserved as the city\'s civilian war memorial, the building provoked a mixed reception. Just after it opened, the shopping centre won the inaugural Carbuncle Cup \"for crimes against architecture\", as the worst new building in the United Kingdom.In 2007 it won two retail industry national awards, one of which was the Retail Week magazine\'s \"Shopping Location of the Year\". \n\nCredit to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Circus_Shopping_Centre"</string>
